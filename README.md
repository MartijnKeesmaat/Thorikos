Here you briefly see the examples that were used and how I transformed them. The process of adapting these examples can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/MartijnKeesmaat/frontend-data/wiki/Examples-&-My-work).

## Install
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is used as the application bundler for this project. The main goal of using Parcel was to use ES6 imports. This allows for the code to be more modular and easier to work with.

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build-prod
```

To create a development build:

```sh
npm run build-dev
```

## Wiki
The [wiki](https://github.com/MartijnKeesmaat/Thorikos/wiki) documents the progress of this project. It goes over the process through the stages of the concept, technical research, visual design and prototype.

## Data
The data that is used comes from the database of the [NMVW collection](https://collectie.wereldculturen.nl/). For the assignment we are asked to use [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) to retrieve the data. 

Data being used in the app regards the main categories and their respective most-used materials. The process of gaining this data is explained on the [quest for the query](https://github.com/MartijnKeesmaat/frontend-data/wiki/Quest-for-the-query) page.
